# homernn

A Python script to train a recurrent neural network to generate Homeric quotes from character-level data (using TensorFlow). Inspired by [Karpathy's blog](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).

To generate a 5000 character sample:

```unix
cd homernn
python test.py
```

(Dependencies are TensorFlow, NumPy, and h5py).
